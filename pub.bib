	abstract = {Studies of outcomes among adults with congenital heart defects (CHDs) have focused on those receiving cardiac care, limiting generalizability. The Congenital Heart Survey To Recognize Outcomes, Needs, and well-beinG (CH STRONG) will assess comorbidities, health care utilization, quality of life, and social and educational outcomes from a US population-based sample of young adults living with CHD.
METHODS: Individuals with CHD born between 1980 and 1997 were identified using active, population-based birth defects surveillance systems from 3 US locations (Arkansas [AR]; Arizona [AZ]; and Atlanta, Georgia [GA]) linked to death records. Individuals with current contact information responded to mailed survey materials during 2016 to 2019. Respondents and nonrespondents were compared using χ2 tests.
RESULTS: Sites obtained contact information for 74.6\% of the 9,312 eligible individuals alive at recruitment. Of those, 1,656 returned surveys, either online (18.1\%) or via paper (81.9\%), for a response rate of 23.9\% (AR: 18.3\%; AZ: 30.7\%; Atlanta, GA: 28.0\%; P value {\textless} .01). For 20.0\% of respondents, a proxy completed the survey, with 63.9\% reporting that the individual with CHD was mentally unable. Among respondents and nonrespondents, respectively, sex (female: 54.0\% and 47.3\%), maternal race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white: 74.3\% and 63.0\%), CHD severity (severe: 33.8\% and 27.9\%), and noncardiac congenital anomalies (34.8\% and 38.9\%) differed significantly (P value {\textless} .01); birth year (1991-1997: 56.0\% and 57.5\%) and presence of Down syndrome (9.2\% and 8.9\%) did not differ.
CONCLUSIONS: CH STRONG will provide the first multisite, population-based findings on long-term outcomes among the growing population of US adults with CHD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the current standard for rejection surveillance in heart transplant recipients. The quantification of donor-specific cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may be an appropriate biomarker for non-invasive rejection surveillance. A multicenter prospective blinded study (DNA-Based Transplant Rejection Test, DTRT) investigated the value of donor fraction (DF), defined as the ratio of cfDNA specific to the transplanted organ to the total amount of cfDNA present in a blood sample.
METHODS: A total of 241 heart transplant patients were recruited from 7 centers. Age at transplant ranged from 8 days to 73 years, with 146 subjects {\textless}18 years and 95 ≥18 years. All the patients were followed for at least 1 year, with blood samples drawn at routine and for-cause biopsies. A total of 624 biopsy-paired samples were included for analysis through a commercially available cfDNA assay (myTAIHEART, TAI Diagnostics Inc.). A blinded analysis of repeated measures compared the outcomes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. All primary clinical end-points were monitored at 100\%. All analysis and conclusions were reviewed by both an independent external oversight committee and the National Institutes of Health-mandated DTRT steering committee.
RESULTS: DF in acute cellular rejection (ACR) 1R/2R (n = 15) was higher than ACR 0R (n = 42) (p = 0.02); DF in antibody-mediated rejection pAMR1 (n = 8) and pAMR2 (n = 12) (p = 0.05) were higher than pAMR0 (n = 466) (p = 0.04 and p = 0.05 respectively). An optimal DF threshold was determined by the use of an ROC analysis, which ruled out the presence of either ACR or antibody-mediated rejection.
CONCLUSIONS: The cell-free DNA DF holds promise as a non-invasive diagnostic test to rule out acute rejection in both adult and pediatric heart transplant populations.},

Ploidy of c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells was assessed using confocal, karyotypic, and flow cytometric technique. Notable differences were found between rodent (rat, mouse) c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells possessing mononuclear tetraploid (4n) content, compared to large mammals (human, swine) with mononuclear diploid (2n) content. In-situ analysis, confirmed with fresh isolates, revealed diploid content in human c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells and a mixture of diploid and tetraploid content in mouse. Downregulation of the p53 signaling pathway provides evidence why rodent, but not human, c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells escape replicative senescence. Single cell transcriptional profiling reveals distinctions between diploid versus tetraploid populations in mouse c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells, alluding to functional divergences. Collectively, these data reveal notable species-specific biological differences in c-kit+ cardiac interstitial cells, which could account for challenges in extrapolation of myocardial from preclinical studies to clinical trials.},

While ROS production has historically been portrayed as an unregulated process driving oxidative stress and disease pathology, contemporary studies reveal that ROS also facilitate normal physiology. Mitochondria are especially abundant in cardiac tissue; hence, mitochondrial dysregulation and ROS production are thought to contribute significantly to cardiac pathology. Moreover, there is growing appreciation that medical therapies designed to mediate mitochondrial ROS production can be important strategies to ameliorate cardiac disease. In this review, we highlight evidence from animal models that illustrates the strong connections between mitochondrial ROS and cardiac disease, discuss advancements in the development of mitochondria-targeted antioxidant therapies, and identify challenges faced in bringing such therapies into the clinic.},

	abstract = {Background In infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow, the impact of palliation strategy on interstage growth and feeding regimen is unknown. Methods and Results This was a retrospective multicenter study of infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow palliated with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent or Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) from 2008 to 2015. Subjects with a defined interstage, the time between initial palliation and subsequent palliation or repair, were included. Primary outcome was change in weight-for-age Z-score. Secondary outcomes included \% of patients on: all oral feeds, feeding-related medications, higher calorie feeds, and feeding-related readmission. Propensity score was used to account for baseline differences. Subgroup analysis was performed in 1- (1V) and 2-ventricle (2V) groups. The cohort included 66 PDA stent (43.9\% 1V) and 195 BTS (54.4\% 1V) subjects. Prematurity was more common in the PDA stent group (P=0.051). After adjustment, change in weight-for-age Z-score did not differ between groups over the entire interstage. However, change in weight-for-age Z-score favored PDA stent during the inpatient interstage (P=0.005) and BTS during the outpatient interstage (P=0.032). At initial hospital discharge, PDA stent treatment was associated with all oral feeds (P{\textless}0.001) and absence of feeding-related medications (P=0.002). Subgroup analysis revealed that 2V but not 1V patients demonstrated significant increase in weight-for-age Z-score. In the 2V cohort, feeding-related readmissions were more common in the BTS group (P=0.008). Conclusions In infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow who underwent palliation with PDA stent or BTS, there was no difference in interstage growth. PDA stent was associated with a simpler feeding regimen and fewer feeding-related readmissions.},

We present a patient-specific in vitro platform capable of sustained flow that can be used to train proceduralists and surgical teams in current interventions, as well as in developing novel therapeutic approaches to treat various vascular anomalies. Our objective is to develop an in vitro model of PA stenosis based on patient data that can be used as an in vitro phantom to model cardiovascular disease and explore potential interventions. Methods and Results From patient-specific scans obtained via computer tomography or 3-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography, we generated digital 3D models of the arteries. Subsequently, in vitro models of tetralogy of Fallot with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries were first 3D printed using biocompatible resins and next bioprinted using gelatin methacrylate hydrogel to simulate neonatal vasculature or second-order branches of an older patient with tetralogy of Fallot with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. Printed models were used to study creation of extraluminal connection between an atretic PA and a major aortopulmonary collateral artery using a catheter-based interventional method. Following the recanalization, engineered PA constructs were perfused and flow was visualized using contrast agents and x-ray angiography. Further, computational fluid dynamics modeling was used to analyze flow in the recanalized model. Conclusions New 3D-printed and computational fluid dynamics models for vascular atresia were successfully created. We demonstrated the unique capability of a printed model to develop a novel technique for establishing blood flow in atretic vessels using clinical imaging, together with 3D bioprinting-based tissue engineering techniques. Additive biomanufacturing technologies can enable fabrication of functional vascular phantoms to model PA stenosis conditions that can help develop novel clinical applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid artery (CA) and axillary artery (AA) access are increasingly used for transcatheter stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), although reports are limited.
METHODS: The Congenital Catheterization Research Collaborative (CCRC) reviewed multicenter data from infants who underwent PDA stenting via the CA or AA approach from 2008 to 2017, and compared outcomes to those of infants undergoing PDA stenting via the femoral artery (FA) approach. Post-procedure ultrasound (US) imaging was reviewed.
RESULTS: Forty-nine infants underwent PDA stenting from the CA (n = 43) or AA (n = 6) approach, compared with 55 infants who underwent PDA stenting from the FA approach. The PDA was the sole pulmonary blood flow (PBF) source in 61\% of infants in the CA/AA cohort, compared with 33\% of the FA cohort (p {\textless} .01). Ductal tortuosity for CA/AA cohort was Type I (straight) in 10 (20\%), Type II (one turn) in 17 (35\%), and Type III (multiple turns) in 22 (45\%) infants and reflected a greater degree of tortuosity when compared to the FA cohort (p {\textless} .01). In 17 infants with CA/AA approach, the "flip technique" was used, and was associated with shorter procedure times for highly tortuous PDA (Type III) patients. Rates of procedural complications were similar across access sites. Most common complications were access site injury (thrombus or bleeding) and stent malposition. No complications were specifically related to the "flip technique."
CONCLUSIONS: Use of CA and AA approach for PDA stenting was found to be more commonly employed in sole source PBF and highly tortuous PDAs. Procedural modifications such as the "flip technique" may lead to shorter procedure times. CA and AA approaches are associated with a similar burden of procedural or late complications. Post-procedural surveillance of the CA and AA is suggested, given the incidence of vascular findings on US.},

	abstract = {Every heartbeat originates from a tiny tissue in the heart called the sinoatrial node (SAN). The SAN harbors only ≈10 000 cardiac pacemaker cells, initiating an electrical impulse that captures the entire heart, consisting of billions of cardiomyocytes for each cardiac contraction. How these rare cardiac pacemaker cells (the electrical source) can overcome the electrically hyperpolarizing and quiescent myocardium (the electrical sink) is incompletely understood. Due to the scarcity of native pacemaker cells, this concept of source-sink mismatch cannot be tested directly with live cardiac tissue constructs. By exploiting TBX18 induced pacemaker cells by somatic gene transfer, 3D cardiac pacemaker spheroids can be tissue-engineered. The TBX18 induced pacemakers (sphTBX18) pace autonomously and drive the contraction of neighboring myocardium in vitro. TBX18 spheroids demonstrate the need for reduced electrical coupling and physical separation from the neighboring ventricular myocytes, successfully recapitulating a key design principle of the native SAN. β-Adrenergic stimulation as well as electrical uncoupling significantly increase sphTBX18s' ability to pace-and-drive the neighboring myocardium. This model represents the first platform to test design principles of the SAN for mechanistic understanding and to better engineer biological pacemakers for therapeutic translation.},

By performing a series of experiments including miRNA sequencing and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-PCR, we found that miR-126 is directly induced by ETV2. Further, we identified that miR-126 can positively regulate the generation of FLK1+ cells by activating the MAPK pathway through targeting SPRED1 (sprouty-related EVH1 domain containing 1). Further, we showed evidence that JUN/FOS activate the enhancer region of FLK1 through AP1 (activator protein 1) binding sequences.

METHODS: Pediatric otolaryngology chiefs of all academic children's hospitals in the US were electronically surveyed about the ways APPs intersected clinically and financially in their respective practice.
RESULTS: A total of 29 of 36 children's hospital-based pediatric otolaryngology practices completed the survey, of which 26 practices (90\%) utilized APP. There were large variances within the APP practice cohort in faculty size (mean/median/range = 9.4/8.5/3-29); annual patient visits (mean/median = 18,373/17,600); number of practice site (mean/median/range = 4.3/4/2-9) and number of outpatient APP (mean/median/range = 6.3/5/1-30). No factors (faculty size, annual visits and number of practice sites) differentiated between the APP and non-APP practices. Among APP practices, significant correlation (p{\textless}.00001) was observed between size of APP cohort to faculty size and annual visits. 69\% of the practices did not differentiate job functions of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. 85\% of the practices utilized APPs in all practice sites and 19\% utilized APPs in the operating room. 77\% of APPs billed independently and 46\% had on-site supervision. The most prevalent APP salary bracket based on 0-5, 6-10 and {\textgreater} 11 years of tenure were \$76-100K (65\%), \$100-150K (77\%) and \$100-150K (86\%), respectively. In 46\% of the practices, APPs were able to generate enough revenue to cover more than 75\% of their salary and 23\% of practices generated a profit. 81\% of the chiefs ranked the effectiveness of APPs as high (4 and 5) on a 5-point Likert scale.
DISCUSSION: The majority of academic pediatric otolaryngology practices employed APPs. Despite the diversity seen in practice complexity, APP functionality and financial impact, most found the APP model to be beneficial in improving patient care, patient access and faculty productivity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with risk of red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs) following pediatric cardiac catheterizations.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a review of all pediatric cardiac catheterizations from 2012 to 2017. The primary endpoint was RBCT within 72 hours of pediatric cardiac catheterization. Patient and procedural factors were reviewed. Generalized linear modelling was performed to describe interactions among relevant risk factors.
RESULTS: In total, 831 RBCTs occurred within 72 hours of 6028 pediatric cardiac catheterizations (13.8\%). Univariate analysis revealed that the prevalence of RBCT was highest among infants (37.6\% incidence of RBCT) and among those with higher estimated blood loss as a percent of blood volume (P = .03). Among infants, multivariate analysis revealed that weight (OR 0.72; 95\% CI 0.63-0.81), complex 2-ventricle (OR 3.14, 95\% CI 2.18-4.57), and single ventricle status (OR 5.21, 95\% CI 3.42-8.01) were associated with risk of RBCT. Inpatient infants from intensive care (OR 4.74; 95\% CI 3.49-6.49) or stepdown units (OR 2.33; 95\% CI 1.58-3.46) were at higher risk. Length of procedure (OR 2.57; 95\% CI 2.03-3.26) and oxygen saturation (OR 0.98; 95\% CI 0.97-0.99; P {\textless} .01) were also associated with RBCTs.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized infants with single ventricle or complex 2-ventricle anatomy are at highest risk of RBCT. Length of procedure, blood loss, and oxygen saturations are additional risk factors associated with RBCT. Operators should consider these factors when planning pediatric cardiac catheterizations, particularly when exposure to RBCT is undesirable.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Primary pulmonary vein stenosis (PPVS) is increasingly diagnosed in children with no prior pulmonary vein intervention history, and management is challenging. We describe characteristics of patients who underwent surgical repair of PPVS at our center, and examine factors associated with treatment failures.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent surgical intervention for PPVS (2002-2016) was completed. Patients who had undergone prior cardiac surgery involving the pulmonary veins or atrial switch were excluded. Regression analyses were performed to examine characteristics, PPVS features, including severity score, and surgical details associated with treatment failures.
RESULTS: Thirty-four children underwent initial surgical intervention for PPVS. Median age was 8.9 months (interquartile range, 5.9-18.4 months). Most patients (n = 31; 91\%) had unilateral pulmonary vein involvement and the median PPVS severity score was 3.5 (interquartile range, 3-5). On competing risk analysis, 1 year following surgical repair, 9\% of patients had died, 14\% had undergone reintervention, and 77\% were alive without reintervention; at 5 years the numbers were 9\%, 30\%, and 61\%, respectively. Factors associated with mortality included bilateral disease and PPVS severity score {\textgreater}6. Bilateral disease and PPVS severity score {\textgreater}5 were associated with reintervention risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary management strategy is required for PPVS. Despite satisfactory early repair, patients continue to be at risk for recurrence and subsequent mortality, especially those with extensive primary involvement. The disappointing results underscore the need for multi-institutional collaborations to better understand this complex disease, establish management and follow-up protocols, and explore investigational treatment modalities that could modify the unfavorable outcome of this uncommon and challenging disease.},

	abstract = {Cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can give rise to de novo chamber cardiomyocytes and nodal pacemaker cells. Compared with our understanding of direct differentiation toward atrial and ventricular myocytes, the mechanisms for nodal pacemaker cell commitment are not well understood. Taking a cue from the prominence of canonical Wnt signaling during cardiac pacemaker tissue development in chick embryos, we asked if modulations of Wnt signaling influence cardiac progenitors to bifurcate to either chamber cardiomyocytes or pacemaker cells. Omitting an exogenous Wnt inhibitor, which is routinely added to maximize cardiac myocyte yield during differentiation of mouse and human ESCs, led to increased yield of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes with action potential properties similar to those of native sinoatrial node pacemaker cells. The pacemaker phenotype was accompanied by enhanced expression of genes and gene products that mark nodal pacemaker cells such as Hcn4, Tbx18, Tbx3, and Shox2. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a ligand, which activates canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, increased the yield of pacemaker-like myocytes while reducing cTNT-positive pan-cardiac differentiation. Conversely, addition of inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling led to increased chamber myocyte lineage development at the expense of pacemaker cell specification. The positive impact of canonical Wnt signaling on nodal pacemaker cell differentiation was evidenced in direct differentiation of two human ESC lines and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Our data identify the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a critical determinant of cardiac myocyte subtype commitment during ESC differentiation: endogenous Wnt signaling favors the pacemaker lineage, whereas its suppression promotes the chamber cardiomyocyte lineage.},

	abstract = {Millimeter-depth sensitivity with frequency domain near-infrared spectroscopy has been challenging due to the breakdown of the diffusion equation for source-detection separations {\textless} 1cm. To overcome this challenge, we employ a Monte-Carlo lookup table-based inverse algorithm to fit small separation (3-6 mm) frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FDNIRS) data for absorption and reduced scattering coefficients. We verify this small separation FDNIRS method through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro, we observed a root mean squared percent error (RMSE) in estimation of the reduced scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient of 2.8\% and 7.6\%, respectively, in liquid phantoms consisting of Intralipid and Indian ink, and a RMSE in estimation of oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin concentrations of 7.8 and 11.2\%, respectively, in blood-mixed liquid phantoms. Next, we demonstrate one particularly valuable in vivo application of this technique wherein we non-invasively measure the optical properties of the mouse brain (n = 4). We find that the measured resting state cerebral oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration are consistent with literature reported values, and we observe expected trends during a hyper-/hypoxia challenge that qualitatively mimic changes in partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) measured simultaneously with an invasive pO2 sensor. Further, through simulations of the mouse head geometry, we demonstrate that the skull and scalp exert minimal influence on the estimate oxygen saturation, while leading to small but systematic underestimation of total hemoglobin concentration. In total, these results demonstrate the robustness of small separation FDNIRS to assess tissue optical properties at millimeter depth resolution.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We measured behavioral, quality of life (QoL), and functional status outcomes for 6-year-old children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome enrolled in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial. We sought to compare these outcomes with those in the normative population and to analyze risk factors for worse outcomes within the single-ventricle group.
METHODS: Parent-response instruments included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Vineland-II) (primary outcome), Behavior Assessment System for Children 2, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0, and other measures of QoL and functional status. We compared subjects with those in the normative sample using 1-sample Wilcoxon rank tests and assessed outcome predictors using multivariable regression.
RESULTS: Of 325 eligible patients, 250 (77\%) participated. Compared with population norms, participants had lower scores on the Vineland-II motor skills domain (90 ± 17 vs 100 ± 15; P {\textless} .001), with 11\% scoring {\textgreater}2 SDs below the normative mean. On nearly all major domains, more study subjects (3.3\%-19.7\%) scored outside the normal range than anticipated for the general population. Independent risk factors for lower Vineland-II scores included perioperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, male sex, use of regional cerebral perfusion, catheterization after stage 2 operation, visual problems, seizure history, and more complications after 2 years (R2 = 0.32). Independent predictors of worse Behavior Assessment System for Children 2 (R2 = 0.07-0.20) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (R2 = 0.17-0.25) domain scores also included sociodemographic factors and measures of morbidity and/or greater course complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: At 6 years, children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome had difficulty in areas of adaptive behavior, behavioral symptoms, QoL, and functional status. Principal risks for adverse outcomes include sociodemographic factors and measures of greater course complexity. However, models reveal less than one-third of outcome variance.},

In the pretreatment step, garlic juice is heated at 55°C for 24 h. The contents of SAC and total polyphenols were increased with treatment of pectinase cocktail; this increase was greater under HHP processing. In contrast, the total flavonoid content was decreased in all pretreatment conditions. Garlic juice pretreated with pectinase cocktail and HHP had a significantly higher content of SAC in the early phase of aging than raw garlic juice, and the SAC was increased over time in both treatment groups. The total polyphenol content of garlic juice was significantly higher in the pretreatment group during the aging period, and the antioxidant activity of garlic juice showed a positive correlation with polyphenol content.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with single ventricle anatomy and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow may be initially palliated with either modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) or ductus arteriosus stent (DAS). Comparisons of outcomes during the interstage period and at the time of superior cavopulmonary connection (SCPC) are lacking and may differ between palliation strategies.
METHODS: Infants with single ventricle anatomy and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow palliated with either DAS or BTS from 2008 to 2015 were reviewed across 4 centers. Interstage outcomes, and for those who had SCPC, anatomy, hemodynamics, and perioperative clinical outcomes were compared. Thirty-five patients with DAS and 136 patients with BTS were included.
RESULTS: At initial palliation, demographic, clinical variables, and pulmonary artery size were similar. Interstage death, transplant, or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis occurred in 25.7\% of DAS and 35.8\% of BTS, P=0.27. Reintervention was more common with DAS (48.6\% versus 2.2\%; P{\textless}0.001). Twenty-three DAS patients and 111 BTS patients underwent SCPC. Preoperative hemodynamics and overall pulmonary atresia growth were similar, although right pulmonary artery growth was better with DAS (change in z-score: 1.57 versus 0.65, P=0.026). SCPC intraoperative and postoperative courses were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with single-ventricle anatomy and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow, interstage outcomes, hemodynamics before SCPC, and acute postoperative outcomes were similar. Overall reintervention was more common in the DAS group, driven by more frequent planned reintervention. Unplanned reintervention, death, and transplant were similar. Both groups demonstrated good pulmonary atresia growth. DAS is a reasonable initial palliative alternative to BTS in select patients.},

However, the association between CHD and autism spectrum disorders (AuSDs) is less well understood. Using administrative data, we sought to determine the association between CHD and AuSD and identify specific CHD lesions with higher odds of developing AuSD.
METHODS: We performed a 1:3 case-control study of children enrolled in the US Military Health System from 2001 to 2013. Children with International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for AuSD were identified as cases and matched with controls on the basis of date of birth, sex, and enrollment time frame. Each child's records were reviewed for CHD lesions and associated procedures. Conditional logistic regression determined odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for comparative associations.
RESULTS: There were 8760 cases with AuSD and 26 280 controls included in the study. After adjustment for genetic syndrome, maternal age, gestational diabetes, short gestation, newborn epilepsy, birth asphyxia, and low birth weight, there were increased odds of AuSD in patients with CHD (OR 1.32; 95\% CI 1.10-1.59). Specific lesions with significant OR included atrial septal defects (n = 82; OR 1.72; 95\% CI 1.07-2.74) and ventricular septal defects (n = 193; OR 1.65; 95\% CI 1.21-2.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Children with CHD have increased odds of developing AuSD. Specific lesions associated with increased risk include atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects. These findings will be useful for counseling parents of children with CHD.},

	abstract = {Nearly 1 in every 120 children born has a congenital heart defect. Although surgical therapy has improved survival, many of these children go on to develop right ventricular heart failure (RVHF). The emergence of cardiovascular regenerative medicine as a potential therapeutic strategy for pediatric HF has provided new avenues for treatment with a focus on repairing or regenerating the diseased myocardium to restore cardiac function. Although primarily tried using adult cells and adult disease models, stem cell therapy is relatively untested in the pediatric population. Here, we investigate the ability of electrical stimulation (ES) to enhance the retention and therapeutic function of pediatric cardiac-derived c-kit+ progenitor cells (CPCs) in an animal model of RVHF. Human CPCs isolated from pediatric patients were exposed to chronic ES and implanted into the RV myocardium of rats. Cardiac function and cellular retention analysis showed electrically stimulated CPCs (ES-CPCs) were retained in the heart at a significantly higher level and longer time than control CPCs and also significantly improved right ventricular functional parameters. ES also induced upregulation of extracellular matrix and adhesion genes and increased in vitro survival and adhesion of cells. Specifically, upregulation of β1 and β5 integrins contributed to the increased retention of ES-CPCs. Lastly, we show that ES induces CPCs to release higher levels of pro-reparative factors in vitro. These findings suggest that ES can be used to increase the retention, survival, and therapeutic effect of human c-kit+ progenitor cells and can have implications on a variety of cell-based therapies.

Despite numerous efforts over the past few decades, the number of the patients with cardiovascular disease still remains high, thereby necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies equipped with a better understanding of the biology of the cardiovascular system. Recently, the ETS transcription factor, ETV2 (also known as ER71), has been recognized as a master regulator of the development of the cardiovascular system and plays an important role in pathophysiological angiogenesis and the endothelial cell reprogramming. Here, we discuss the detailed mechanisms underlying ETV2/ER71-regulated cardiovascular lineage development. In addition, recent reports on the novel functions of ETV2/ER71 in neovascularization and direct cell reprogramming are discussed with a focus on its therapeutic potential for cardiovascular diseases.},

Compared with our understanding of the constituents of their electrical excitation, little is known about the metabolic underpinnings that drive the automaticity of pacemaker myocytes. This lack is largely owing to the scarcity of native cardiac pacemaker myocytes. Here, we take advantage of induced pacemaker myocytes generated by TBX18-mediated reprogramming (TBX18-iPMs) to investigate comparative differences in the metabolic program between pacemaker myocytes and working cardiomyocytes. TBX18-iPMs were more resistant to metabolic stresses, exhibiting higher cell viability upon oxidative stress. TBX18-induced pacemaker myocytes (iPMs) expensed a lower degree of oxidative phosphorylation and displayed a smaller capacity for glycolysis compared with control ventricular myocytes. Furthermore, the mitochondria were smaller in TBX18-iPMs than in the control. We reasoned that a shift in the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission was responsible for the smaller mitochondria observed in TBX18-iPMs. We identified a mitochondrial inner membrane fusion protein, Opa1, as one of the key mediators of this process and demonstrated that the suppression of Opa1 expression increases the rate of synchronous automaticity in TBX18-iPMs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TBX18-iPMs exhibit a low metabolic demand that matches their mitochondrial morphology and ability to withstand metabolic insult.},

Methods and Results Using 2007 to 2013 IBM MarketScan Commercial Databases, we identified women with CHD diagnosis codes ages 15 to 44 years who became pregnant and were enrolled in health insurance for ≥11 months in the year before estimated conception. We assessed documentation of complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, liver function, ECG, comprehensive echocardiogram, and exercise stress test, using procedural codes, and outpatient prescription claims for US Food and Drug Administration category D and X cardiac-related medications. Differences were examined according to CHD severity, age, region of residence, year of conception, and documented encounters at obstetric and cardiology practices. We found 2524 pregnancies among 2003 women with CHD (14.4\% severe CHD).

Also, research-level skin-wearable devices, while excelling in some aspects, fall short as concept-only presentations due to the fundamental challenges of active wireless communication and integration as a single device platform. Here, an all-in-one, wireless, stretchable hybrid electronics with key capabilities for real-time physiological monitoring, automatic detection of signal abnormality via deep-learning, and a long-range wireless connectivity (up to 15 m) is introduced. The strategic integration of thin-film electronic layers with hyperelastic elastomers allows the overall device to adhere and deform naturally with the human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. The stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact are capable of generating clinical-grade electrocardiograms and accurate analysis of heart and respiratory rates while the motion sensor assesses physical activities. Implementation of convolutional neural networks for real-time physiological classifications demonstrates the feasibility of multifaceted analysis with a high clinical relevance. Finally, in vivo demonstrations with animals and human subjects in various scenarios reveal the versatility of the device as both a health monitor and a viable research tool.},

In this paper, we demonstrate intracellular potential monitoring of cardiomyocytes using simple 2D planar electrode array in a standard CMOS process without patch clamps or post fabricated 3D nanoelectrodes. This is enabled by our unique cardiomyocytes/fibroblasts co-culturing technique and electroporation. The co-cultured fibroblasts promote tight sealing of cardiomyocytes on electrodes and enable high-fidelity intracellular potential monitoring based on 2D planar electrode.

Suboptimal efficiency of current clinical therapies to resurrect the infarcted heart results in injured heart enlargement and remodeling to maintain its physiological functions. These remodeling processes ultimately leads to ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF). Recent therapeutic approaches (e.g., regenerative and nanomedicine) have shown promise to prevent HF postmyocardial infarction in animal models. However, these preclinical, clinical, and technological advancements have yet to yield substantial enhancements in the survival rate and quality of life of patients with severe ischemic injuries. This could be attributed largely to the considerable gap in knowledge between clinicians and nanobioengineers. Development of highly effective cardiac regenerative therapies requires connecting and coordinating multiple fields, including cardiology, cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry and chemistry, and mechanical and materials sciences, among others. This review is particularly intended to bridge the knowledge gap between cardiologists and regenerative nanomedicine experts. Establishing this multidisciplinary knowledge base may help pave the way for developing novel, safer, and more effective approaches that will enable the medical community to reduce morbidity and mortality in HF patients.},

	abstract = {The frequency, indications, and outcomes for readmission following pediatric heart transplantation are poorly characterized. A better understanding of this phenomenon will help guide strategies to address the causes of readmission. Data from the Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation for Children (CTOTC-04) multi-institutional collaborative study were utilized to determine incidence of, and risk factors for, hospital readmission within 30 days and 1 year from initial hospital discharge. Among 240 transplants at 8 centers, 227 subjects were discharged and had follow-up. 129 subjects (56.8\%) were readmitted within one year; 71 had two or more readmissions. The 30-day and 1-year freedom from readmission were 70.5\% (CI: 64.1\%, 76.0\%) and 42.2\% (CI: 35.7\%, 48.7\%), respectively. The most common indications for readmissions were infection followed by rejection and fever without confirmed infection, accounting for 25.0\%, 10.6\%, and 6.2\% of readmissions, respectively. Factors independently associated with increased risk of first readmission within 1 year (Cox proportional hazard model) were as follows: transplant in infancy (P = .05), longer transplant hospitalization (P = .04), lower UNOS urgency status (2/IB vs 1A) at transplant (P = .04), and Hispanic ethnicity (P = .05). Hospital readmission occurs frequently in the first year following discharge after heart transplantation with highest risk in the first 30 days. Infection is more common than rejection as cause for readmission, with death during readmission being rare. A number of patient factors are associated with higher risk of readmission. A fuller understanding of these risk factors may help tailor strategies to reduce unnecessary hospital readmission.},

	abstract = {Hematopoiesis is a finely regulated process in vertebrates under both homeostatic and stress conditions. By whole exome sequencing we have studied the genomics of acute lymphoid leukemia patients who needed multiple red blood cell transfusions after intensive chemotherapies. ARHGEF12, encoding a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor, was found associated with chemotherapy-induced anemia by genome-wide association study analyses. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ARHGEF12 located in an intron predicted to be a GATA1 binding site, rs10892563, is significantly associated with patients who need red blood cell transfusion (P=3.469E-03, odds ratio 5.864). A luciferase reporter assay revealed that this SNP impairs GATA1 mediated trans-regulation of ARHGEF12, and quantitative PCR studies confirmed that the homozygotes status is associated with {\textasciitilde}61\% reduction of ARHGEF12 expression (P=0.0088). Consequently, erythropoiesis was affected at the pro-erythroblast phase in the patients. A role of ARHGEF12 and its homologs in erythroid differentiation was confirmed in human K562 cells, mouse 32D cells and primary murine bone marrow cells. We further demonstrated in zebrafish by morpholino-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of arhgef12 that its reduction resulted in erythropoiesis defects. The p38 kinase pathway was affected by the ARHGEF12-RhoA signaling in K562 cells, and consistently, the arhgef12-rhoA-p38 pathway was also shown to be important for erythroid differentiation in zebrafish as active rhoA or p38 readily rescued the impaired erythropoiesis caused by arhgef12 knocking down. Finally, ARHGEF12 mediated p38 activity also appeared to be involved in phenotypes of patients of the rs10892563 homozygous genotype. Our findings present a novel SNP of ARHGEF12 that may involve ARHGEF12-RhoA-p38 signaling in erythroid regeneration in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients after chemotherapy.},

Although various TIC markers and their antibodies have been proposed, it is limited to the use of antibodies for in vivo imaging or treatment of TIC. In this study, we discovered heme oxygenase 2 (HMOX2) as a novel biomarker for TIC and developed a selective small molecule probe TiNIR (tumor initiating cell probe with near infrared). TiNIR detects and enriches the functionally active TIC in human lung tumors, and through the photoacoustic property, TiNIR also visualizes lung TIC in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TiNIR inhibits tumor growth by blocking the function of HMOX2, resulting in significantly increased survival rates of the cancer model mice. The novel therapeutic target HMOX2 and its fluorescent ligand TiNIR will open a new path for the molecular level of lung TIC diagnosis and treatment.},

Rise time, action potential duration, beat period, and triangulation were used to quantify compound responses and AP morphology changes induced by genetic modification.

PLSR reduced the dimensionality of the data set to the top 40 miRNAs with the highest weighted coefficients for the in vitro biological responses. Target pathway analysis of these top 40 miRNAs demonstrated significant fit to cardiac angiogenesis and fibrosis pathways. Although the model was trained on in vitro data, we demonstrate that the model can predict angiogenesis and fibrosis responses to exosome treatment in vivo with a strong correlation with published in vivo responses. These studies demonstrate that PLSR modeling of exosome miRNA content has the potential to inform preclinical trials and predict new promising CPC therapies.

	abstract = {Rationale: Mitochondrial Ca2+ loading augments oxidative metabolism to match functional demands during times of increased work or injury. However, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload also directly causes mitochondrial rupture and cardiomyocyte death during ischemia-reperfusion injury by inducing mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) mediates mitochondrial Ca2+ influx, and its activity is modulated by partner proteins in its molecular complex, including the MCUb subunit. Objective: Here we sought to examine the function of the MCUb subunit of the MCU-complex in regulating mitochondria Ca2+ influx dynamics, acute cardiac injury and long-term adaptation after ischemic injury. Methods and Results:Cardiomyocyte-specific MCUb overexpressing transgenic mice and Mcub gene-deleted (Mcub-/-) mice were generated to dissect the molecular function of this protein in the heart. We observed that MCUb protein is undetectable in the adult mouse heart at baseline, but mRNA and protein are induced after ischemia-reperfusion injury. MCUb overexpressing mice demonstrated inhibited mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in cardiomyocytes and partial protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Antithetically, deletion of the Mcub gene exacerbated pathologic cardiac remodeling and infarct expansion after ischemic injury in association with greater mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Furthermore, hindlimb remote ischemic pre-conditioning induced MCUb expression in the heart, which was associated with decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, collectively suggesting that induction of MCUb protein in the heart is protective. Similarly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Mcub-/- mice were more sensitive to Ca2+ overload. Conclusions: Our studies suggest that Mcub is a protective cardiac inducible gene that reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and permeability transition pore opening after ischemic injury to reduce ongoing pathological remodeling.},

A retrospective cohort analysis was performed comparing death as a primary outcome and stroke and acute kidney injury as secondary outcomes, across the study period divided into a study period of 3 timed eras. We analyzed 88 patients supported by a VAD over a 24-year timeframe. The duration, age at implant and indication for VAD support did not change significantly across the eras.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving intervention for severe respiratory and cardiac diseases. However, 50\% of survivors have abnormal neurologic exams. Current ECMO management is guided by systemic metrics, which may poorly predict cerebral perfusion. Continuous optical monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics during ECMO holds potential to detect risk factors of brain injury such as impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA).
METHODS: We conducted daily measurements of microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation, and total hemoglobin concentration using diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and frequency-domain diffuse optical spectroscopy in nine neonates. We characterize CA utilizing the correlation coefficient (DCSx) between CBF and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during ECMO pump flow changes.
RESULTS: Average MAP and pump flow levels were weakly correlated with CBF and were not correlated with cerebral oxygen saturation. CA integrity varied between individuals and with time. Systemic measurements of MAP, pulse pressure, and left cardiac dysfunction were not predictive of impaired CA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot results suggest that systemic measures alone cannot distinguish impaired CA from intact CA during ECMO. Furthermore, optical neuromonitoring could help determine patient-specific ECMO pump flows for optimal CA integrity, thereby reducing risk of secondary brain injury.
IMPACT: Cerebral blood flow and oxygenation are not well predicted by systemic proxies such as ECMO pump flow or blood pressure. Continuous, quantitative, bedside monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation with optical tools enables new insight into the adequacy of cerebral perfusion during ECMO. A demonstration of hybrid diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies to continuously measure cerebral blood oxygen saturation and flow in patients on ECMO, enabling assessment of cerebral autoregulation. An observation of poor correlation of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation with systemic mean arterial pressure and ECMO pump flow, suggesting that clinical decision making guided by target values for these surrogates may not be neuroprotective. {\textasciitilde}50\% of ECMO survivors have long-term neurological deficiencies; continuous monitoring of brain health throughout therapy may reduce these tragically common sequelae through brain-focused adjustment of ECMO parameters.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Assess differences in approaches to and provision of developmental care for infants undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease.
STUDY DESIGN: A collaborative learning approach was used to stratify, assess, and compare individualized developmental care practices among multidisciplinary teams at 6 pediatric heart centers. Round robin site visits were completed with structured site visit goals and postvisit reporting. Practices of the hosting site were assessed by the visiting team and reviewed along with center self-assessments across specific domains including pain management, environment, cue-based care, and family based care coordination.
RESULTS: Developmental care for infants in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) varies at both a center and individual level. Differences in care are primarily driven by variations in infrastructure and resources, composition of multidisciplinary teams, education of team members, and use of developmental care champions. Management of pain follows a protocol in most cardiac intensive care units, but the environment varies across centers, and the provision of cue-based infant care and family-based care coordination varies widely both within and across centers. The project led to proposed changes in clinical care and center infrastructure at each participating site.
CONCLUSIONS: A collaborative learning design fostered rapid dissemination, comparison, and sharing of strategies to approach a complex multidisciplinary care paradigm. Our assessment of experiences revealed marked variability across and within centers. The collaborative findings were a first step toward strategies to quantify and measure developmental care practices in the cardiac intensive care unit to assess the association of complex inpatient practices with long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.},

Results of studies with controlled motion in tissue-mimicking phantoms indicate UIAU could provide significantly higher CTRs (maximum: 17.3 ± 0.9 dB) relative to conventional pulse inversion imaging (maximum CTR: 3.4 ± 1.4 dB).

We investigated fixation failures after IM nailing in elderly patients with trochanteric fractures and compared the failure group with nonfailure group to identify risk factors of fixation failure.
Methods: A total of 396 patients aged 65 years or older underwent IM nailing for trochanteric fractures between January 2012 and August 2016 at our institution. Of those, 194 patients who were followed up for more than 12 months were enrolled in this study; 202 patients were excluded due to death during follow-up, bedridden status before injury, and loss to follow-up. All patients underwent plain radiography and preoperative computed tomography (CT).
Results: Fixation failure occurred in 11 patients (5.7\%). Seven patients had stable fractures (AO/OTA); eight patients had basicervical fractures (confirmed by CT). Five patients had comminution in the greater trochanter (confirmed by CT). Regarding fracture reduction, eight patients showed discontinuity in the anterior cortex. The position of the lag screw on the lateral view was in the center in six patients and in a posterior area in the other five patients. On the basis of comparison with the 183 patients without fixation failure, risk factors of fixation failure were higher body mass index (BMI; p = 0.003), basicervical type of fracture (p = 0.037), posterior placement of the lag screw on the lateral view (p {\textless} 0.001), and inaccurate reduction of the anterior cortex (p = 0.011).
Conclusions: Among the risk factors of fixation failure after IM nailing in elderly patients with trochanteric fractures, discontinuity of the anterior cortex and posterior position of the lag screw are modifiable surgeon factors, whereas higher BMI and basicervical type of fracture are nonmodifiable patient factors. Therefore, care should be taken to avoid fixation failure in IM nailing for patients with a basicervical type of fracture or higher BMI or both.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can provide crucial support for single ventricle (SV) patients at various stages of palliation. However, characterization of the utilization and outcomes of ECMO in these unique patients remains incompletely studied.
METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective review of SV patients between 2010 and 2017 who underwent ECMO cannulation with primary end point of survival to discharge and secondary end point of survival to decannulation or orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Multivariate analysis was performed for factors predictive of survival to discharge and survival to decannulation.
RESULTS: Forty SV patients with a median age of one month (range: 3 days to 15 years) received ECMO support. The incidence of ECMO was 14\% for stage I, 3\% for stage II, and 4\% for stage III. Twenty-seven (68\%) patients survived to decannulation, and 21 (53\%) patients survived to discharge, with seven survivors to discharge undergoing OHT. Complications included infection (40\%), bleeding (40\%), thrombosis (33\%), and radiographic stroke (45\%). Factors associated with survival to decannulation included pre-ECMO lactate (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.90, P = .013) and post-ECMO bicarbonate (HR: 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.0-1.5, P = .018). Factors associated with survival to discharge included central cannulation (HR: 40.0, 95\% CI: 3.1-500.0, P = .005) and lack of thrombotic complications (HR: 28.7, 95\% CI: 2.1-382.9, P = .011).
CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be useful to rescue SV patients with approximately half surviving to discharge, although complications are frequent. Early recognition of the role of heart transplant is imperative. Further study is required to identify areas for improvement in this population.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In recent decades, fine-dust particulate matter (FM) has become a potential health hazard, causing various pathological respiratory disorders around the world. Inflammation induced by FM is regarded as a major cause of respiratory disorder in humans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Shibashin Misena®, a functional food composed of various bioactive ingredients, on FM-induced respiratory disorders in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Briefly, 40 mice were divided equally into four groups: normal controls (NC); FM-induced control group (FC); FM group treated with Shibashin Misena® 0.1 mL/head/day (FM0.1); FM group treated with Shibashin Misena® 0.2 mL/head/day (FM0.2).
RESULTS: FM significantly induced TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-1β, and TGF-β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collected from the FM mice. Compared with FC, Shibashin Misena® decreased TNF-α, IL-17A, and IL-1β levels in BALF, and histopathologic evaluations revealed that Shibashin Misena® treatment significantly reduced inflammatory-cell infiltration and fibrosis related collagen deposition in lung tissue.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that Shibashin Misena® decreased FM-induced inflammation and fibrosis in lung tissue. Thus, Shibashin Misena® could be an effective supplement to prevent or improve FM-induced pulmonary disorders.},

	abstract = {Patients with aortic heart valve disease are limited to valve replacements that lack the ability to grow and remodel. This presents a major challenge for pediatric patients who require a valve capable of somatic growth and at a smaller size. A patient-specific heart valve capable of growth and remodeling while maintaining proper valve function would address this major issue. Here, we recreate the native valve leaflet structure composed of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and cell-laden gelatin-methacrylate/poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (GelMA/PEGDA) hydrogels using 3D printing and molding, and then evaluate the ability of the multilayered scaffold to produce collagen matrix under physiological shear stress conditions. We also characterized the valve hemodynamics under aortic physiological flow conditions. The valve's fibrosa layer was replicated by 3D printing PCL in a circumferential direction similar to collagen alignment in the native leaflet, and GelMA/PEGDA sustained and promoted cell viability in the spongiosa/ventricularis layers. We found that collagen type I production can be increased in the multilayered scaffold when it is exposed to pulsatile shear stress conditions over static conditions. When the PCL component was mounted onto a valve ring and tested under physiological aortic valve conditions, the hemodynamics were comparable to commercially available valves. Our results demonstrate that a structurally representative valve leaflet can be generated using 3D printing and that the PCL layer of the leaflet can sustain proper valve function under physiological aortic valve conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This is a cross-sectional study aiming to understand the early characteristics and background of bone health impairment in clinically well children with Fontan circulation.
METHODS: We enrolled 10 clinically well children with Fontan palliation (operated {\textgreater}5 years before study entrance, Tanner stage ≤3, age 12.1 ± 1.77 years, 7 males) and 11 healthy controls (age 12.0 ± 1.45 years, 9 males) at two children's hospitals. All patients underwent peripheral quantitative CT. For the Fontan group, we obtained clinical characteristics, NYHA class, cardiac index by MRI, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and biochemical studies. Linear regression was used to compare radius and tibia peripheral quantitative CT measures between Fontan patients and controls.
RESULTS: All Fontan patients were clinically well (NYHA class 1 or 2, cardiac index 4.85 ± 1.51 L/min/m2) and without significant comorbidities. Adjusted trabecular bone mineral density, cortical thickness, and bone strength index at the radius were significantly decreased in Fontan patients compared to controls with mean differences -30.13 mg/cm3 (p = 0.041), -0.31 mm (p = 0.043), and -6.65 mg2/mm4 (p = 0.036), respectively. No differences were found for tibial measures. In Fontan patients, the mean height-adjusted lumbar bone mineral density and total body less head z scores were -0.46 ± 1.1 and -0.63 ± 1.1, respectively, which are below the average, but within normal range for age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: In a clinically well Fontan cohort, we found significant bone deficits by peripheral quantitative CT in the radius but not the tibia, suggesting non-weight-bearing bones may be more vulnerable to the unique haemodynamics of the Fontan circulation.},

While the conventional biomarkers for diabetes have been glucose and insulin concentrations in the blood, the direct determination of the pancreatic β cell mass would provide critical information for the disease status and progression. By combining fluorination and diversity-oriented fluorescence library strategy, we have developed a multimodal pancreatic β cell probe PiF for both fluorescence and for PET (positron emission tomography). By simple tail vein injection, PiF stains pancreatic β cells specifically and allows intraoperative fluorescent imaging of pancreatic islets. PiF-injected pancreatic tissue even facilitated an antibody-free islet analysis within 2 h, dramatically accelerating the day-long histological procedure without any fixing and dehydration step. Not only islets in the pancreas but also the low background of PiF in the liver allowed us to monitor the intraportal transplanted islets, which is the first in vivo visualization of transplanted human islets without a prelabeling of the islets. Finally, we could replace the built-in fluorine atom in PiF with radioactive 18F and successfully demonstrate in situ PET imaging for pancreatic islets.},

The Congenital Heart Survey To Recognize Outcomes, Needs, and well-beinG (CH STRONG) will assess comorbidities, health care utilization, quality of life, and social and educational outcomes from a US population-based sample of young adults living with CHD.
METHODS: Individuals with CHD born between 1980 and 1997 were identified using active, population-based birth defects surveillance systems from 3 US locations (Arkansas [AR]; Arizona [AZ]; and Atlanta, Georgia [GA]) linked to death records. Individuals with current contact information responded to mailed survey materials during 2016 to 2019. Respondents and nonrespondents were compared using χ2 tests.
RESULTS: Sites obtained contact information for 74.6\% of the 9,312 eligible individuals alive at recruitment. Of those, 1,656 returned surveys, either online (18.1\%) or via paper (81.9\%), for a response rate of 23.9\% (AR: 18.3\%; AZ: 30.7\%; Atlanta, GA: 28.0\%; P value {\textless} .01). For 20.0\% of respondents, a proxy completed the survey, with 63.9\% reporting that the individual with CHD was mentally unable. Among respondents and nonrespondents, respectively, sex (female: 54.0\% and 47.3\%), maternal race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white: 74.3\% and 63.0\%), CHD severity (severe: 33.8\% and 27.9\%), and noncardiac congenital anomalies (34.8\% and 38.9\%) differed significantly (P value {\textless} .01); birth year (1991-1997: 56.0\% and 57.5\%) and presence of Down syndrome (9.2\% and 8.9\%) did not differ.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the current standard for rejection surveillance in heart transplant recipients. The quantification of donor-specific cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may be an appropriate biomarker for non-invasive rejection surveillance. A multicenter prospective blinded study (DNA-Based Transplant Rejection Test, DTRT) investigated the value of donor fraction (DF), defined as the ratio of cfDNA specific to the transplanted organ to the total amount of cfDNA present in a blood sample.
METHODS: A total of 241 heart transplant patients were recruited from 7 centers. Age at transplant ranged from 8 days to 73 years, with 146 subjects {\textless}18 years and 95 ≥18 years. All the patients were followed for at least 1 year, with blood samples drawn at routine and for-cause biopsies. A total of 624 biopsy-paired samples were included for analysis through a commercially available cfDNA assay (myTAIHEART, TAI Diagnostics Inc.). A blinded analysis of repeated measures compared the outcomes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. All primary clinical end-points were monitored at 100\%. All analysis and conclusions were reviewed by both an independent external oversight committee and the National Institutes of Health-mandated DTRT steering committee.
RESULTS: DF in acute cellular rejection (ACR) 1R/2R (n = 15) was higher than ACR 0R (n = 42) (p = 0.02); DF in antibody-mediated rejection pAMR1 (n = 8) and pAMR2 (n = 12) (p = 0.05) were higher than pAMR0 (n = 466) (p = 0.04 and p = 0.05 respectively). An optimal DF threshold was determined by the use of an ROC analysis, which ruled out the presence of either ACR or antibody-mediated rejection.
CONCLUSIONS: The cell-free DNA DF holds promise as a non-invasive diagnostic test to rule out acute rejection in both adult and pediatric heart transplant populations.},

Moreover, there is growing appreciation that medical therapies designed to mediate mitochondrial ROS production can be important strategies to ameliorate cardiac disease. In this review, we highlight evidence from animal models that illustrates the strong connections between mitochondrial ROS and cardiac disease, discuss advancements in the development of mitochondria-targeted antioxidant therapies, and identify challenges faced in bringing such therapies into the clinic.},

Methods and Results This was a retrospective multicenter study of infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow palliated with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent or Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) from 2008 to 2015. Subjects with a defined interstage, the time between initial palliation and subsequent palliation or repair, were included. Primary outcome was change in weight-for-age Z-score. Secondary outcomes included \% of patients on: all oral feeds, feeding-related medications, higher calorie feeds, and feeding-related readmission. Propensity score was used to account for baseline differences. Subgroup analysis was performed in 1- (1V) and 2-ventricle (2V) groups. The cohort included 66 PDA stent (43.9\% 1V) and 195 BTS (54.4\% 1V) subjects. Prematurity was more common in the PDA stent group (P=0.051). After adjustment, change in weight-for-age Z-score did not differ between groups over the entire interstage. However, change in weight-for-age Z-score favored PDA stent during the inpatient interstage (P=0.005) and BTS during the outpatient interstage (P=0.032). At initial hospital discharge, PDA stent treatment was associated with all oral feeds (P{\textless}0.001) and absence of feeding-related medications (P=0.002). Subgroup analysis revealed that 2V but not 1V patients demonstrated significant increase in weight-for-age Z-score. In the 2V cohort, feeding-related readmissions were more common in the BTS group (P=0.008). Conclusions In infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow who underwent palliation with PDA stent or BTS, there was no difference in interstage growth. PDA stent was associated with a simpler feeding regimen and fewer feeding-related readmissions.},
